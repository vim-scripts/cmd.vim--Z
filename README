This scheme was made for the 16 color full screen console in Windows XP. It's named "cmd" after cmd.exe. Full screen consoles give an immersive experience I prefer over a window. But there aren't many schemes designed for a 16 color console.

Every option has been tested in the windows XP console to make sure it looks OK. (except for commented options)
